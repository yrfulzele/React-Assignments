What is a key in React ?
In React, a key is a special string attribute that needs to be included when creating lists of elements. 
Keys help React to identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
They should be unique among siblings in the list. When React renders a list, it uses the key attribute to track each elementâ€™s identity. 
This helps React update the UI efficiently, ensuring that the correct components are re-rendered when the list changes.

How to display images in react?

For images stored locally in your application, you can import them into your React component and use the imported image paths to create <img> elements. 
Otherwise, if you need to fetch images from an API, you can utilize libraries such as fetch or axios to make an API call. Once the images are retrieved, 
you can map over the fetched image data to generate <img> elements for each image.
